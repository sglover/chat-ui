    "instruction": "A 5G slice is network service that use a virtual network created on top of a 5G physical network. \nThere are three types of slices: \n- massive Machine-Type Communications: identified by the acronym mMTC, this type of network slice aims to \nprovide connectivity to a large number of IOT sensors over a small geographical area. The goal is to support up \nto one million of IOT devices in a square kilometer. The characteristics of the service include low bandwitdh, \nin the order of a few kilobytes per second (kbps), due to the small amount of data that IoT sensors usually \ntransmit and low to medium latency, in the order of a maximum of 49 milliseconds, to minimize the communication time and \nthus thehe battery consumption of the IoT sensors. A colloquial summary of this type of network slice would be: \nconnecting all the things \n- Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications: identified by the acronym uRLLC, this type of network slice aims to \nprovide connectivity to mission critical services such as remote surgery, remote driving or autonomous cars. The \ncharacteristics of the service include ultra low latency, with a maximum of 7 milliseconds, and ultra reliable \ncommunications, in the order of 99.99% service availability. A colloquial summary of this type of network slice \nwould be to stay connected with low lag \n- Enhanced Mobile BroadBand: identified by the acronym emBB, this type of network slice aims to \nprovide connectivity to mobile users and devices. The characteristics of the service include support for \nuser or device speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, and large bandwitdh requirements, in the order of tens of \ngigabits per second, to support as many user applications as possible, irrespective of their characteristics. \nA colloquial summary of this type of network slice would be: faster on the go\n\nA service can be described using the following form: \n[start of description] \nThe type of the service should be {CHOICE: [mMTC, eMBB, uRLLC]} \nThe description of the service should contain a summary of the service requestThe maximum delay of the service should be[NUM: 100] milliseconds \nThe maximum number of users that can simultaneously use the service should be [NUM: 2000] \nThe maximum number of sessions simultaneously active in the service should be [NUM: 10000] \nThe coverage area of the service, corresponding to the administrative area over \nwhich the service is available should be {CHOICE: [area_1, area_2, area_3, area_4]} \n[end of description] \nRules: \n0. If unknown is selected as type of service, terminate the description, without specifying the rest  \nof the values \n1. If you see phrases like [NUM: default_value], replace the entire phrase with a numerical value.\n2. use default_value unless an alternative value is explicitly requested, which should be used instead \n3. If you see phrases like CHOICE: [choice1, choice2, ...], it means you should replace the entire phrase \nwith one of the choices listed. Be sure to replace all of them. If you are not sure about the value, \njust use the last choice \n4. For services of type uRLLC, the maximum delay should never exceed 7. For services of type mMTC, \nthe maximum delay should never exceed 49. Use these values for these two types of services if needed. \n5. The maximum number of sessions should be 5 times the maximum number of users. \nTo ensure it, multiply the maximum number of users by 5, and use the resulting value of the multiplication \nfor the value of maximum number of sessions\n6. There are four coverage areas in the united states: area_1, area_2, area_3 and area_4. area_1 includes \nthe states of California and Nevada. area_2 include the states of Texas and New Mexico. area_3 includes \nthe states of Montana and Oregon. area_4 includes the rest of the states in the united states of america.\n7. When a state is specified in the \nservice request, the corresponding area should be selected as the coverage area for the service. \n8.
